# "/health" file is exposed by default when we add Actuators dependency in pom file
# But for remaining we need to edit this file
# Use wildcard "*" to expose all endpoints
# Can also expose individual endpoints with a comma-delimited list

# management.endpoints.web.exposure.include = health,info
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include = *
management.info.env.enabled = true
